## Project link
Clone [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/AdrianoCucci/CPOS-Capstone-App "Repo title")

## Prerequisite

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node title") and npm 
2. Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/ "Angular Title")
3. Install the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli "Ionic Title")
```
$ npm install -g ionic
```


## Start the project 
The project is started with the regular ionic commands.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `ionic serve` to start the development environment.
3. To build the project run `ionic build android` or `ionic build ios`. In order for you to build an iOS app, you need to run on MacOS.

## Run the App

### Testing in browser
The majority of Ionic app development can be spent right in the browser using the `ionic serve` command:

```
$ cd newAppName
$ ionic serve
```

### Build & Run on a real device 

```
$ ionic cordova build android/ios
$ ionic cordova run android/ios
```

## Getting Started

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AdrianoCucci/CPOS-Capstone-App.git`
* Fork the repo

## Create a Firebase Project
Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to [create a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-project) to connect to your app.

## Register your app
After you have a Firebase project, you can add your web app to it.

## Install dependencies
[@angular/fire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire) is the official Angular library for Firebase, we’ll install both packages:
```
$ npm install firebase @angular/fire --save
```
## Setup Firebase
To initialize Firebase in your app, you need to provide your app’s [Firebase project configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#config-object). Copy it on src/environments/environment.ts
```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: '',
    authDomain: '',
    databaseURL: '',
    projectId: '',
    storageBucket: '',
    messagingSenderId: '',
    appId: '',
    measurementId: ''
  }
};
```
## Setup Google Maps
For the application to interact with Google Maps, you will need an API key for both Android and iOS.
Follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, [create a Google Console account](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. See [how to setup API keys in the Google Console](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en).
3. Create two different API keys for Android an iOS.
4. Add restrictions to both API keys. 
   1. For the Android key:
      1. Under **Application restrictions**, select **Android apps**.
      2. Under **API restrictions**, select **Restrict key**.
      3. From the **Select APIs** drop-down list, select **Maps SDK for Android**
      4. Save your changes to the API key.
   1. For the iOS key:
      1. Under **Application restrictions**, select **iOS apps**.
      2. Under **API restrictions**, select **Restrict key**.
      3. From the **Select APIs** drop-down list, select **Maps SDK for iOS**
      4. Save your changes to the API key.
5. Add both API keys to the application's ```config.xml``` file located in the root directory here:
   ```
   <plugin name="uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator" source="npm">
       <variable name="GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID" value="(YOUR-ANDROID-KEY)" />
   </plugin>
   <preference name="GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY" value="(YOUR-ANDROID-KEY)" />
   <preference name="GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_API_KEY" value="(YOUR-IOS-KEY)" />
   ```
Once complete, there is one last API key you must create for the server. See the next step below for details.

## Server Setup
This project has a server written in associated with it responsible for making Google Maps API requests, which can be found here:
[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/AdrianoCucci/CPOS-Capstone-Server "Repo title")

When hosting the server, be sure to reference its URL in the value of the global ```apiHost``` string located in:
[src/app/services/google-maps/google-maps.service.ts](https://github.com/AdrianoCucci/CPOS-Capstone-App/blob/master/src/app/services/google-maps/google-maps.service.ts) on line 46 (without a trailing slash).
The Google Maps Service will send HTTP GET requests to this URL, where the server should then return a Google Maps API response.
